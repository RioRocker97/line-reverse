# LINE-Detect ###DONE###
an reverse image search on Line official account Interface

## Why ?
Bacause Why not ?(again)

## How does it work ?
Using On-Cloud Bot-server (with GCP's Cloud Function) integreated with Cloud vision API to do web detection .

## Developer's note
  -  still in early state so... don't expect everything to be pretty
  - performance still slow . might wanna implement Asynchronous communication later
  - Cloud service is very useful
